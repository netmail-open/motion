# motion
RESTful JSON interface for email queue

Motion is an open project from Netmail which presents a new, modern means of interacting with an email queue.

Goals:
- Accept mail from authenticated sources (augment, not replace SMTP)
- Act as (or replace) submission port
+ Built-in and external services
  - Condition services: match message data with criteria
  - Action services: policy engine, delivery, anything (outside scope)
- Reference implementation in NodeJS: condition services, forward to SMTP
